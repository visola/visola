Some people think I have super powers but the truth is that I like being challenged. ğŸ”¥
And I have amazing friends and family that always supported me. :heart:

I like learning something new every day so I'm always finding new projects to work on.
That means you may get lost in my repositories, so please first check the pinned repositories below.
I'm an expert in Java and Javascript but I've studied a few other languages, including: Python and Go.

Besides learning programming languages I also love learning spoken and written languages.
My native language is portuguese (ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·) but I'm also fluent in english (ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸).
I've also studied: spanish (ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸), german (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª), chinese (mandarin) (ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³), french (ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·) and I am currently studying japenese (ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ).


I also run marathons.
I've ran 3 of the 6 majors: Boston, Chicago and Berlin.
I've also ran a few other marathons: Athens, Providence (RI), Cape Code (MA), Philadelphia and Narragansett (RI).
