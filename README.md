Welcome to my profile!
I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer @ [Klaviyo](https://klaviyo.com) and the technical and operational lead @ [Revollu](https://revollu.com/).
Previously a SW engineer at [Toast](https://pos.toasttab.com/), [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/).

I've co-authored two books:
- [Java Fundamentals](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JDGYLW2) - A fast-paced and pragmatic introduction to one of the world's most popular programming languages
- [Professional Javascript](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RS28BNP0) - Develop your JavaScript programming skills by learning strategies and techniques commonly used in modern full-stack application development

I love learning together and sharing knowledge and I'd love to connect.

# About me

Some people think I have super powers but the truth is that I like being challenged. ðŸ”¥
And I have amazing friends and family that always supported me. :heart:

I like learning something new every day so I'm always finding new projects to work on.
That means you may get lost in my repositories, so please first check the pinned repositories below.
I'm an expert in Java and Javascript but I've studied a few other languages, including: Python and Go.

Besides learning programming languages I also love learning spoken and written languages.
My native language is portuguese (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) but I'm also fluent in english (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸).
I've also studied: spanish (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸), german (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª), chinese (mandarin) (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³), french (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) and I am currently studying japenese (ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ).

I also run marathons.
I've ran 3 of the 6 majors: Boston, Chicago and Berlin.
I've also ran a few other marathons: Athens, Providence (RI), Cape Code (MA), Philadelphia and Narragansett (RI).
